# DXVK-MacOS

A maintained macOS/Wine fork of [Gcenx/DXVK-macOS](https://github.com/Gcenx/DXVK-macOS), refreshed onto upstream [DXVK v3.1.1](https://github.com/doitsujin/DXVK/releases/tag/v3.1.1).

This fork brings Gcenx's MoltenVK compatibility work to DXVK 3.1 and its `dxbc-spirv` shader compiler. It also builds ARM64X DLLs for [MetalSharp Wine](https://github.com/metalsharp/MetalSharp-Wine) (arm64 Wine with FEX).

## Release contents

A `v*` tag builds a release (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) with four packages, each with its licenses and `SHA256SUMS`:

- `dxvk-macos-<tag>-x86_64`: `d3d8.dll`, `d3d9.dll`, `d3d10core.dll`, `d3d11.dll` and `dxgi.dll` for x86_64 Windows programs (`x86_64-windows`)
- `dxvk-macos-<tag>-i386`: the same for 32-bit Windows programs (`i386-windows`)
- `dxvk-macos-<tag>-arm64x`: the same as ARM64X for an arm64 Wine that runs x86_64 programs with FEX (MetalSharp Wine). x86_64 programs load them as ARM64EC from `x86_64-windows`, so DXVK itself runs natively.
- `moltenvk-<tag>-universal`: the universal (arm64 + x86_64), ad-hoc signed `libMoltenVK.dylib` and `MoltenVK_icd.json`. It is built by [metalsharp/VKD3D-Proton-MacOS](https://github.com/metalsharp/VKD3D-Proton-MacOS)'s `scripts/fetch-sources.sh moltenvk` and `scripts/build-moltenvk.sh --externals` at the commit the workflow pins (`VKD3D_PROTON_MACOS_REV`). That is the same MoltenVK, with the same MoltenVK and SPIRV-Cross fixes, that VKD3D-Proton-MacOS ships and MetalSharp Wine runs. DXVK 3.1 needs those fixes on Metal:
  - workgroup sizes taken from `LocalSizeId`;
  - runtime-sized descriptor arrays;
  - compute shaders with groupshared memory;
  - geometry pipelines without multisample state;
  - geometry shader limits.

Pushes and pull requests build the x86_64, i386 and ARM64X lanes in `.github/workflows/build-macos-cross.yml`. The ARM64X DLLs are checked with `tools/ci/check-arm64x.py`.

The DXVK `dxgi.dll` is a D3D8/9/10/11 lane. VKD3D-Proton's D3D12 lane uses DXVK's `dxgi.dll`, `d3d11.dll` and `d3d10core.dll` for swap chains and D3D11On12. VKD3D-Proton-MacOS's arm64 release pins this fork's ARM64X build for that. Don't mix in a `dxgi.dll` from another DXVK version.

## Requirements

- Meson and Ninja
- `glslangValidator`
- Git with recursive submodule support
- For the x86_64 and i386 lanes, MinGW-w64 cross-compilers: `x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc/g++` and `i686-w64-mingw32-gcc/g++`
- For the ARM64X lane, [llvm-mingw](https://github.com/mstorsjo/llvm-mingw) (20261020 or later), with the `arm64ec-w64-mingw32` target, on `PATH`
- At run time: MoltenVK, from the release's `moltenvk` package or a VKD3D-Proton-MacOS build. Upstream MoltenVK lacks the fixes above, and DXVK 3.1 renders parts of games wrong or not at all with it.

DXVK 3.1 needs Vulkan 1.3, `VK_KHR_maintenance5`, `VK_KHR_maintenance6` and `VK_KHR_load_store_op_none`. The MoltenVK above reports them on Apple silicon.

## Build from source

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/metalsharp/DXVK-MacOS.git
cd DXVK-MacOS
```

Apply the MoltenVK patch to the `dxbc-spirv` submodule before building:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
git -C subprojects/dxbc-spirv apply ../../patches/dxbc-spirv-moltenvk.patch
```

Build the 64-bit Windows lane:

```bash
meson setup build.x86_64 \
  --cross-file build-win64.txt \
  --buildtype release \
  --prefix "$PWD/stage/x86_64"
meson compile -C build.x86_64
meson install -C build.x86_64
```

Build the 32-bit Windows lane:

```bash
meson setup build.i386 \
  --cross-file build-win32.txt \
  --buildtype release \
  --prefix "$PWD/stage/i386"
meson compile -C build.i386
meson install -C build.i386
```

Build the ARM64X lane for MetalSharp Wine, with llvm-mingw on `PATH`:

```bash
meson setup build.arm64x \
  --cross-file build-arm64x.txt \
  --buildtype release \
  --prefix "$PWD/stage/arm64x"
meson compile -C build.arm64x
meson install -C build.arm64x
python3 tools/ci/check-arm64x.py stage/arm64x/*/*.dll
```

`build-arm64x.txt` builds with `-marm64x`. Each DLL then holds ARM64 code for arm64 programs and ARM64EC code for x86_64 programs.

## MoltenVK options

These `dxvk.conf` options exist only in this fork:

```ini
# Each D3D9 sampler slot gets a separate binding per texture type (2D, cube, 3D). Metal cannot
# alias image views of different types on one binding. Auto: on with MoltenVK.
d3d9.deAliasedSamplers = Auto

# D3D9 draws that sample a bound render target read a copy of it instead. Metal has no
# feedback loops. Auto: one copy per draw with MoltenVK. False: one copy shared between draws.
d3d9.renderTargetHazardCopies = Auto
```

The second option ports [Gcenx/DXVK-macOS#21](https://github.com/Gcenx/DXVK-macOS/pull/21) to DXVK 3.1.

On MetalSharp Wine, DXVK adds a line to the Metal performance HUD with the API, its feature level and DXVK's version. For example, `DXVK D3D11 FL_11_1 <version>`.

## Wine Vulkan portability fix

MoltenVK is reported as a Vulkan portability driver. Wine must enable `VK_KHR_portability_enumeration` and `VK_INSTANCE_CREATE_ENUMERATE_PORTABILITY_BIT_KHR` when creating the host Vulkan instance.

Apply the included patch to the matching Wine source tree:

```bash
cd /path/to/wine-source
git apply /path/to/DXVK-MacOS/patches/wine-vulkan-portability.patch
```

Rebuild the Unix `win32u` library and use the rebuilt Wine runtime. Keep the original Wine runtime backed up until application validation is complete.

## Runtime setup

Use a wow64 prefix for Steam-style mixed 64-bit/32-bit applications:

```bash
export WINEARCH=wow64
export WINEPREFIX=/path/to/prefix
```

Keep the DXVK DLLs and MoltenVK files in the same graphics lane. Set the loader and ICD paths before launching:

```bash
export DXVK_CONFIG_FILE=/path/to/dxvk.conf
export VK_ICD_FILENAMES=/path/to/moltenvk/MoltenVK_icd.json
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/moltenvk
export WINEDLLOVERRIDES='d3d8,d3d9,d3d10core,d3d11,dxgi=n,b'
```

Copy the DLLs into the prefix's `system32` (64-bit, or ARM64X on MetalSharp Wine) and `syswow64` (i386) folders, or into the game's folder.
