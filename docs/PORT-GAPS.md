# What the DXVK 3.1 port still needs

*2026-10-28. Compares Gcenx's DXVK-macOS 1.10.3 (98 commits on upstream v1.10.3) with this fork at `8d348236`
(upstream v3.1.1 plus `40e01640`), against the MoltenVK in MetalSharp Wine 4.0. Capabilities come from
`docs/baselines/baseline-M4-macOS27-metalsharp-wine-4.0.json`; see `docs/gap-policy.md`.*

The fork's goal is one DXVK for MetalSharp's Arm64 FEX build: the D3D8/9/10/11 lane (`GRAPHICS_BACKEND=dxvk`, today
DXVK-macOS 1.10.3) and the DXGI and D3D11On12 half of the VKD3D-Proton lane (today plain upstream DXVK 2.7.1, built for
x86_64 only, so it runs under FEX).

## What the MoltenVK probe changed

MetalSharp's MoltenVK passes every feature and extension DXVK 3.1.1 requires. It also has geometry shaders (as Metal
mesh pipelines), stream 0 transform feedback, `VK_EXT_depth_clip_enable`, cull distances (as clip distances),
`robustBufferAccess2` and `nullDescriptor`. Several items the 2026-09-21 gap policy treated as permanent gaps are
therefore checks, not workarounds, and the five requirements this fork relaxed in `dxvk_device_info.cpp`
(`geometryShader`, `shaderCullDistance`, `depthClipEnable`, `robustBufferAccess2`, `nullDescriptor`) can return to
upstream's strictness. A MoltenVK without them would then be rejected at device creation instead of rendering wrongly.

Still missing in MoltenVK: graphics pipeline libraries, pipeline statistics queries, custom border colors, descriptor
buffers, present timing, multiple transform feedback streams, and correct geometry shader limits (all reported as 0).

## D3D11 and the VKD3D-Proton lane: status

| # | Item | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Pipeline-statistics query crash (`dxvk_gpu_query.cpp`, `d3d11_query.cpp`) | **Done** (`faec9f8f`): such queries return zeros. Stream-output queries do the same for streams the device lacks |
| 2 | D3D11On12 device check (`dxvk_adapter.cpp` `importDevice`) | **Done** (`93d57c74`): logs the first requirement the imported device misses. VKD3D-Proton-MacOS now enables the two it missed, `inlineUniformBlock` and `VK_KHR_load_store_op_none` |
| 3 | The VKD3D lane's DXGI fixes (VKD3D-Proton-MacOS `patches/dxvk/0001`) | **Done** (`93d57c74`): flip-model buffer counts and the D3D11On12 error message; the other two changes are upstream |
| 4 | ARM64X build | **Done** (`53b4318e`, `build-arm64x.txt`): dxgi, d3d11, d3d10core, d3d9 and d3d8 build as ARM64X. CI still builds only x86_64 and i386 |
| 5 | Geometry shader limits | **Done** in MoltenVK (VKD3D-Proton-MacOS): Vulkan's minimums (256 output vertices, 1024 total components, 32 invocations) instead of 0 |
| 6 | Stream output | **Open.** MoltenVK crashed creating the pipeline (`newMTLGeometryRenderPipelineDescriptor` read the null `pMultisampleState` of a rasterizer-discard pipeline); that is fixed in VKD3D-Proton-MacOS, but the stream output buffer stays empty. DXVK 2.7.1 on the same MoltenVK writes nothing either |
| 7 | Restore upstream's requirements | **Done** (`d8ab94b8`) |
| 8 | Depth clip guard | Not needed while item 7 holds: a device without `VK_EXT_depth_clip_enable` is rejected |
| 9 | Feature level reporting | Not yet checked in games |
| 10 | A smoke test that draws | **Done**: `tools/smoke/d3d11_draw.c` |

### `tools/smoke/d3d11_draw.c` results

x86_64 test program under MetalSharp Wine 4.0 with `GRAPHICS_BACKEND=vkd3d` (the VKD3D-Proton lane, where DXVK
provides dxgi, d3d11 and d3d10core), Apple M4, 2026-10-28. "Shipped" is that lane as MetalSharp Wine 4.0 ships it
(DXVK 2.7.1 for x86_64, MoltenVK at d1070b55); "this branch" is DXVK at this branch as ARM64X with the
VKD3D-Proton-MacOS MoltenVK and VKD3D-Proton changes.

| Test | Shipped | This branch |
|---|---|---|
| `draw` | pass | pass |
| `depth_clip` | pass | pass |
| `pipeline_stats` | crash (null query pool) | pass (zeros) |
| `stream_output` | fail (buffer empty) | fail (buffer empty) |
| `geometry_shader` | fail (nothing drawn) | pass |
| `d3d11on12` | pass | pass, device meets every DXVK requirement |

VKD3D-Proton's `test_draw_instanced`, `test_clear_render_target_view`, `test_fragment_coords`,
`test_shader_instructions` and `test_geometry_shader*` give the same results on both.

## Needed later

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| Async pipeline compiling (P4) | No graphics pipeline libraries, no state cache (removed upstream in `57d5a1e4`) and no `VkPipelineCache`, so every new pipeline compiles while the game waits. 1.10.3's `dxvk_pipecompiler` maps onto 3.1.1's `DxvkPipelineWorkers` at `dxvk_graphics.cpp:1086-1115` |
| D3D9 render-target copies | 1.10.3 `7865799f` and `91fdf892` |
| D3D9 shadow samplers | 3.1.1 de-aliases 3 image variants per sampler, 1.10.3 had 5. Check shadow samplers |
| App profiles | LEGO and KSP2 from 1.10.3 |
| Stream-output `S_OK` fallback | 1.10.3 `ce15afaa`. Only for a MoltenVK without transform feedback |
| Docs | README's `../patches` path (CI uses `../../patches`), its `dxvk.conf` claim, and the state cache mentioned in `PHASE2-REPORT.md` |
